For the present, can only run DigraphBen.py, which is Digraph+GraphSHA

(1) changing default in def parse_args():,
for example:
parser.add_argument('--withAug', type=bool, default=False, help='with Aug or not')

(2) Run DigraphBen.py
if args.withAug is default as True, the result is DiGraph+ dataset imbalancelized + GraphSHA
else, the result is DiGraph+ dataset imbalancelized + without GraphSHA

Run other .py, only get results: model + original dataset( without imbalancelized) +without GraphSHA


Directed Dataset options:
WebKB/Cornell, 'WebKB/texas', 'WebKB/wisconsin'         ---tested OK
'WikipediaNetwork/chameleon', ---tested OK
'WikipediaNetwork/crocodile', ---The dataset 'crocodile' is not available in case 'geom_gcn_preprocess=True'
'WikipediaNetwork/squirrel'     ---tested OK,
'WikiCS/'       ---tested OK, too time consuming
'cora_ml/'     ---tested OK,
'citeseer_npz/'       ---tested OK  too much time
'dgl/cora', 'dgl/citeseer', and some other large datasets as shown in function,(dgl cuda need install to work)

Tested Undirected Dataset options:
CiteSeer
Cora

Too large to run experiments:
PUbMed: too large so only can run in GPU3090, even SymDiGCN is too large for GPU3090
Amazon_computers: 10 days to run one experiment


tested GNNs:
GIN,
SAGE, GCN, GAT,
APPNP,
Cheb
DiG
SymDiGCN
